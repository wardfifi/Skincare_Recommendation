### Removing NA's

```{r}
Christina0_600 <- read_excel("data/final_scraped_1200/Christina0-600.xlsx")
fifi601_1200 <- read_excel("data/final_scraped_1200/fifi601_1200_.xlsx")
scraped_sephora <- bind_rows(Christina0_600, fifi601_1200)

colnames(scraped_sephora)

filter <- scraped_sephora  %>% 
  filter(!(`Skin Type` =="N/A" |`Skin Concerns` == "N/A" | `Product Rating` == "N/A"))

#View(filter)
sum(is.na(filter))

dim(filter)
```

First we combined the excel scraped data. From there, we filter out all the rows/products that have `NA` values from the column Skin Type, Skin Concerns, and Product Rating because this implies that the products are not skincare products, but makeup or hair.

### Formatting Price, Rating, Reviews, Size

```{r}
library(openxlsx)

filter <- filter %>% 
  mutate(across(`Product Price`, ~ as.numeric(gsub("\\$", "", .)))) %>%  # remove $ from price
  mutate(
    `Product Price` = as.numeric(`Product Price`),      # Ensure numeric conversions
    `Product Rating` = round(as.numeric(`Product Rating`), 1), 
    `Product Reviews` = as.numeric(`Product Reviews`)) %>% 
  mutate(`Product Size` = case_when( 
      `Product Size` == "N/A" ~ "No Size", 
      TRUE ~ `Product Size`      # change N/A to No size
    ) )

head(filter)
View(filter)
write.xlsx(filter, "data/filtered_sephora.xlsx", overwrite = TRUE)


```

We did some data cleaning for our dataset to remove the `$` sign for our `Product Price` column and convert it to numeric columns for modeling. We also round all the `Product Rating` numbers to ensure data consistency.

### Plot Product Rating and Reviews

```{r}
# Plot distribution of Product Rating
ggplot(filter, aes(x = `Product Rating`)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 30, fill = "darkseagreen1", alpha = 0.7, color = "black") +
  geom_density(aes(y = ..density.. * 30), color = "deeppink3", size = 1) +  # Overlay density
  labs(title = "Distribution of Product Ratings", x = "Rating", y = "Count") +
  theme_minimal()

# Plot distribution of Product Reviews (log scale to handle large variations)
ggplot(filter, aes(x = `Product Reviews`)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 30, fill = "darkseagreen", alpha = 0.7, color = "black") +
  scale_x_log10() +  # Log scale for better visualization
  labs(title = "Distribution of Product Reviews", x = "Number of Reviews (log10)", y = "Count") +
  theme_minimal()
```
